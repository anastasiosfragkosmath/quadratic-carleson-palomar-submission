# The source-size active overlap cutoff and its prefix estimate

The concrete cutoff `(s+1)(1+2^s)` has size `O((s+1)2^s)` and logarithm
at most `2s+1`. The pruned actual prefix estimate is unconditional. The
exceptional-set result retained from the previous module is first-moment
decay, not the stronger exponential tail needed to finish the source proof.
