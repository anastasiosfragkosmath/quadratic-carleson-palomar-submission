# The full-operator high contribution is bounded by the L log L modular

We make the paper's unspecified large cutoff constant explicit: `B_k = 20·2^k`.
With the proved exponent `β = 1/10`, the numerical high-frequency series is
summable. This theorem needs an explicit disjoint interval family, but no
construction of a Calderón--Zygmund decomposition and no unproved operator
estimate.
